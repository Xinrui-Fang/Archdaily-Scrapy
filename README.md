# High Definition Architecture Pictures Scrapy Plugin of Archdaily 
## Introduction
* **Project Time:** 09.2018
* **Theme:** High Definition Architecture Pictures Scrapy Plugin of Archdaily 
* **Objective:** This is a scrapy plugin script I write for architectures. When I worked as an internship in Dali Senario Design Studio, I found that when architectures made concept design, they need to collect a mount of related architecture pictures from GOOOOD or Archdaily. I also took part in this work for weeks. It was boring and spent a lot of time. The issue is if users want to download a high definition architecture pictures on GOOOOD, He need to click the image and amplify it then download. After that you need to click X on the up right to return back to download the second images. Archdaily is better but still unfriendly to architectures. In order to solve this problem and save the time of architecture, I wrote this scapy plugin to download architectures pictures automatically.
## Pain Point
* Click image to amplify it
* Click"查看原图" to download the picture
* Click"回文章" to return back and continue to read the article.
